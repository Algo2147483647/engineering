## Standardization + Industrialize

**Standardization**: Standardization through stratification ensures that capabilities or products at each tier can achieve rapid iteration through foundational lower-level components. Modular enhancement at each layer enable immediate upper-level capabilities adoption and seamless transparent upgrades. It ensures developers only focus on iteration for standardized development, avoiding redundant construction. 

**Construction process for standardized production system**:  

- **Accumulation**: Establish a structured accumulation mechanism in parallel with the development process to systematically capture standardized model components. This ensures high consistency and stability in the core abstraction layer of the system.
- **Virtuous circle**: Redirect human resources freed by standardization efforts toward strategic priorities â€” optimizing platform experience, enhancing system performance, and expanding support for diversified scenarios. This creates a self-reinforcing loop where efficiency gains drive innovation and scalability.

**Industrialize**: Implement streamlined assembly-line production models through standardized components, industrialized workflows, and scale deployment. This enables mass production of baseline functionalities.

**Balance between standardization & personalization**: Meanwhile, standardization empowers autonomy to focus on tailored adaptations for niche requirements. The framework balances standardization with personalization, ensuring agility without compromising systemic coherence.

## Low Code

$$
\text{Code} \xrightarrow{} \text{DSL (JSON)} \xrightarrow{} \text{Visual Assembly}
$$

The evolution of development approaches fundamentally seeks equilibrium between abstraction levels, development efficiency, and flexibility:

- **Code**: Native code development suits technical validation phases and complex logic prototyping. It provides full programming freedom, serving as the foundational technical infrastructure that supports upper-layer abstractions.

- **DSL (JSON)**: A standardized, structured specification crystallized through long-term practice, translating business logic into machine-readable declarative descriptions via Domain-Specific Language (DSL). Achieves decoupling of business logic from implementation details, realizing Configuration as Code paradigm.

- **Visual Assembly**: Implements visual workbench with atomic component libraries enabling drag-and-drop interface orchestration to generate DSL (JSON), significantly lowering technical dependency thresholds.
