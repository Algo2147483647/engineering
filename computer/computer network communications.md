### Computer network layering models

**Computer network layering models** employ a design philosophy of layered abstraction, achieving inter-layer decoupling, independent encapsulation of functionality within each layer, and promoting standardization.

- **Layered abstraction**: Single responsibility principle, each layer only solves one type of problem. Each layer interacts only with adjacent layers via well-defined interfaces, hiding implementation details. Lower layers provide services to upper layers. Breaks down complex networking tasks into smaller, manageable layers, with each layer handling a specific function.
- **Inter-layer decoupling**: Layers can be updated or replaced independently. This enables flexibility and fosters innovation.
- **Peer-to-Peer Communication**: The $N$-th layer of the sender only talks to the $N$-th layer of the receiver. Data must be passed down layer by layer, transmitted through the physical medium, and parsed up layer by layer at the receiving end.
- **Standard interface**: Protocols at each layer adhere to standardized specifications, ensuring interoperability between diverse hardware and software vendors.
- **Encapsulation**: When data is passed from top to bottom, each layer adds its own control header to form a new data unit.



Detailed description of each layer in computer network layering model:

- **Application Layer**: Provides service required by users. This lawyer directly addresses user needs, offering interfaces  for applications to assess network service. It encompasses network application protocols directly used by users (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SMTP).
- **Presentation Layer**: Ensures data can be correctly interrupted. This layer resolves data compatibility issues between heterogeneous systems (e.g., communication between a Windows program and a Linux server). It handles the syntax and semantics of information exchanged between communication systems, performing data format transformation (e.g., encryption, compression, encoding conversion), ensuring data sent from the source host's application layer can be correctly by the destination host's application layer. 
- **Session Layer**: Organizes and manages communication sessions. This layer is responsible for establishing ,managing and terminating sessions between application processes. It manages long term interactive tasks, Prize session Synchronization and dialogue control.
- **Transport Layer**: Ensures end-to-end communication between processes. This layer is responsible for implementing reliable or unreliable data transfer, flow control, and error control between application processes on the source and destination hosts, compensating for the potential unreliable of the network layer below.
- **Network Layer**: Facilitates packet transmission across networks. This layer is responsible for the path selection (routing) and logical addressing of packets traveling from a source host across multiple networks to a destination host. It handles the interconnection and interpretability between different networks.
- **Data-link Layer**: Ensures reliable data transmission over a single network link. This layer provides reliable data transmission between two directly connected nodes on the same physical network segment. It organizes the raw bit stream received from our physical layer into frame, performing frame delimitation, synchronization, error detection, flow control, and media access control. It shields the upper layer from the differences in the underlying physical media.
- **Physical layer**:  Transmits raw bit streams over physical media. this layer defines electrical, mechanical, timing, and functional interface specifications, handling the sending and receiving of bits.

> Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) (7 Layers): A theoretical reference model proposed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). It defines a complete framework for network communication, divided into seven layers. Although there are few protocol stacks that fully follow OSI in practice, it is the gold standard for understanding network concepts and protocol functions.

> Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) (4 Layers): The protocol stack that actually runs on the Internet. It was developed by the US Department of Defense ARPANET project and is the cornerstone of the Internet. It is simpler and more implementation-focused than the OSI model.
