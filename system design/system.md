# Engineering Systems

【什么是系统?】 系统是对一个宏大工程问题的综合性解决方案。工程认知包含两个视角：(1) 解释现实[Description System]: 构建能解释并贴合客观现实的系统模型。(2) 利用现实[Resolution System]: 针对现实中的具体问题, 提出解决方案。—— 因此, 系统是和环境(问题集合)长期磨合后的产物, 伴随环境的变化而动态演变。优秀的工程系统一定因地制宜, 并以当前环境为基础, 正向循环演化能够解决更多的问题, 适应更广阔的环境, 就像生命体一样。

【系统与复杂性】复杂性不会消失, 只会转移。复杂性是量化系统的核心, 工程系统一定是复杂的, 因为他要解决是复杂现实的问题, 只有复杂性才能处理复杂性。因此, 系统的复杂性约束方法 —— 软件设计思想和范式, 目的是将复杂性控制在人脑可以企及的范围内, 并作为建设系统的规范让人快速理解 (e.g. MVC, DDD, workflow, Event-Condition-Action)。例如, DDD 架构的核心是反映业务本质的领域对象, 数据库字段作为其持久化投影, 因此分析数据库领域对象可以作为理解系统业务的快速突破口。

【系统与标准化】系统标准化是演化的关键方向, 目标是实现系统的工业化和流水线作业。(1) 组件标准化: 在解决特定环境问题的长期实践中，开发人员不断积累被反复验证有效的解决方案片段，逐渐沉淀为可复用的标准化组件。为上层应用提供模块化的即时接入、切换和无感知升级能力。(2) 开放能力标准化: 归纳系统所能解决的问题域范围及服务边界, 提供对外接入的标准化协议, 实现标准化能力中台, 支撑内外部业务场景的快速接入与集成。



The essence of engineering lies in constructing solutions through a foundational logic of "context-problem-resolution" progression. As the embodiment of engineering philosophy, a system represents an integrated solution to complex engineering challenges. Such solutions exhibit distinctive characteristics: systems emerge through prolonged interaction with their environment (specific problem domains), evolving into paradigmatic frameworks that effectively address entire categories of problems. These frameworks maintain dynamic adaptability, continuously transforming in response to environmental shifts.

Exceptional systems demonstrate two core attributes: first, contextual congruence – their architectural design remains fundamentally rooted in the practical requirements of their operational domain; second, dynamic evolvability – through establishing mutually reinforcing feedback mechanisms with their environment, systems simultaneously enhance their problem-solving capabilities while expanding their application scope via continuous iteration. This self-reinforcing evolutionary characteristic enables systems to maintain enduring vitality amidst environmental changes.

## System Evolution

### Standardization + Industrialize

**Standardization**: Standardization through stratification ensures that capabilities or products at each tier can achieve rapid iteration through foundational lower-level components. Modular enhancement at each layer enable immediate upper-level capabilities adoption and seamless transparent upgrades. It ensures developers only focus on iteration for standardized development, avoiding redundant construction. 

**Construction process for standardized production system**:  

- **Accumulation**: Establish a structured accumulation mechanism in parallel with the development process to systematically capture standardized model components. This ensures high consistency and stability in the core abstraction layer of the system.
- **Virtuous circle**: Redirect human resources freed by standardization efforts toward strategic priorities — optimizing platform experience, enhancing system performance, and expanding support for diversified scenarios. This creates a self-reinforcing loop where efficiency gains drive innovation and scalability.

**Industrialize**: Implement streamlined assembly-line production models through standardized components, industrialized workflows, and scale deployment. This enables mass production of baseline functionalities.

**Balance between standardization & personalization**: Meanwhile, standardization empowers autonomy to focus on tailored adaptations for niche requirements. The framework balances standardization with personalization, ensuring agility without compromising systemic coherence.

### Low Code

$$
\text{Code} \xrightarrow{} \text{DSL (JSON)} \xrightarrow{} \text{Visual Assembly}
$$

The evolution of development approaches fundamentally seeks equilibrium between abstraction levels, development efficiency, and flexibility:

- **Code**: Native code development suits technical validation phases and complex logic prototyping. It provides full programming freedom, serving as the foundational technical infrastructure that supports upper-layer abstractions.

- **DSL (JSON)**: A standardized, structured specification crystallized through long-term practice, translating business logic into machine-readable declarative descriptions via Domain-Specific Language (DSL). Achieves decoupling of business logic from implementation details, realizing Configuration as Code paradigm.

- **Visual Assembly**: Implements visual workbench with atomic component libraries enabling drag-and-drop interface orchestration to generate DSL (JSON), significantly lowering technical dependency thresholds.
